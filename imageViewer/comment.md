## Parts that I can learn from

* I love the design that can show the image in original size when user clicks on it.
* Comments in the codes are sufficient, easy to read.
* The codes use function well, there's no duplicated codes.
* The **onload** function can be used to control something at the begining.

## Room for improvement

* I think the *class*, *id* of the **modal** part in html is a little bit confusing, especially **modal** is class name of a component while it's the id of the other. This makes codes difficult to read.
* The size of the image after being clicked is a little distorted.
